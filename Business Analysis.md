# Introduction
## Business purpose
Describe at the organizational level the reason and background for which the organization is pursuing new business or changing the current business in order to fit a new management environment. In this context, it should describe how the proposed system will contribute to meeting business objectives.
## Business scope
Define the business domain under consideration by:
a) identifying the business domain by name;
b) defining the range of business activities included in the business domain concerned. The scope can be defined in terms of divisions in the organization and external entities that relate directly to the business activities, or functions to be performed by the business activities. It is helpful to show environmental entities that are outside of the scope;
c) describing the scope of the system being developed or changed. The description includes assumptions on which business activities are supported by the system.
## Overview
Describe major internal divisions and external entities of the business domain concerned and how they are interrelated. A diagrammatic description is recommended.
## Definitions 
Any words that are used in a special way within the business or organization.
## Major stakeholders 
List the major stakeholders or the classes of stakeholders and describe how they will influence the organization and business or can be related to the development and operation of the system. A stakeholder is an "Individual or organization having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations".

# Business management requirements
## Business environment
Define external and internal environmental factors that should be taken into consideration in understanding the new or existing business and eliciting the stakeholder requirements for the system to be developed or changed. The environmental factors should include possible influences on the business and consequently the system from external conditions like market trends, laws, and regulations, social responsibilities, and technology base.
## Mission, goals, and objectives
Describe the business results to be obtained through or by the proposed system. 
## Business model
Describe methods by which the business mission is expected to be achieved. The description should be concentrated on the methods supported by the system to be developed or changed with the items such as products and services, geographies and locales, distribution channels, business alliance and partnership, and finance and revenue model.
## Information environment
Describe the overall strategy for the organization-level decisions on common bases for multiple information systems. It should include the following items.
a) project portfolio – when multiple system projects are running or planned to pursue the same business goal, the priority, relative positioning, and possible constraints come from the portfolio management strategy.
b) long-term system plan – when common system infrastructure or architecture has been decided or planned, it should be described as constraints on possible design decisions.
c) database configuration – an organization-level database configuration plan and possible
constraints on the availability and accessibility of the organization's global data should be specified.
# Business operational requirements
## Business processes
Provide a description of the procedures of business activities and possible system interfaces within the processes. The purpose of this information item is to represent how and in which context the system supports the business activities. In general, business processes make an ordered structure with decomposition and classification. Each business process should be uniquely named and numbered in the structure. The description of the individual business process should be represented as a diagram representing a sequence of activities.
## Business operational policies and rules
This section is important! The business probably has a policies and procedures manual. Find it. Include in your page any of the policies and rules related to the business operation. 
Describe logical propositions applied in conducting the business processes. The propositions may be conditions to start, branch and terminate the sequence of the business activities in the business processes; criteria for judgment in the business processes; or formula to evaluate a quantity, which will likely be addressed in functional requirements in the SyRS and SRS. The policies and rules shall be uniquely named and numbered, and shall be referenced in the description of the business processes.
## Business operational constraints
Describe conditions to be imposed in conducting the business process. The conditions may be on a performance constraint (e.g., the process shall be finished within a day after the triggering event occurs), or from a management requisite such as 'every occurrence of the process shall be monitored and recorded'.
## Business operational modes
Describe methods to conduct the business operation in an unsteady state, for example, a state when business operations might be extremely busy due to some intensive occurrence of events. An unsteady state of business operation includes a manual operation mode when the proposed system is not available due to some unexpected situation like an accident or natural disaster.
## Business operational quality
Define the level of quality required for the business operation. For example, a business process may address required urgency with higher priority than the reliability of the business process.
## Business structure
Identify and describe the structures in the business relevant to the system, such as organizational structure (divisions and departments), role and responsibility structures, geographic structures, and resource-sharing structures. There may be a need to align the system functions to these structures and to support future structural changes.

# Preliminary operational concept of proposed system
## Preliminary operational concept - Describe the proposed system in a high-level manner, indicating the operational features that are to be provided without specifying design details. The following information should be included:
### a) operational policies and constraints;
### b) description of the proposed system; 
### c) modes of system operation;
### d) user classes and other involved personnel; and
### e) support environment. 
## Preliminary operational scenarios - Describe examples of how users/operators/maintainers will interact with the system in important contexts of use. The high-level scenarios are described for an activity or a series of activities of business processes supported by the system. The scenarios should be uniquely named and numbered and should be referenced in the description of the business processes in 9.3.9.
# Other preliminary life-cycle concepts
## Preliminary acquisition concept - describes the way the system solution will be acquired including  aspects such as stakeholder engagement, source of the solution, requirements definition, solicitation and contracting issues, design, production and verification.
## Preliminary deployment concept - describes the way the system solution will be validated, delivered and introduced into operations.
## Preliminary support concept - describes the desired support infrastructure and manpower considerations for supporting the system solution after it is deployed. A support concept addresses operating support, engineering support, maintenance support, supply support and training support.
## Preliminary retirement concept - describes the way the system will be removed from operation and retired, including the disposal of any hazardous materials used in or resulting from the process.
# Project Constraints 
Describe constraints to performing the project within cost and schedule.
